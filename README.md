**How to use the bot:**

Use ``!weather -c`` command followed by the place for which one you want to know the weather

    ex: !weather Paris

You can change settings with the ``!weather -s`` command. Send ``!weather -s help`` to get a list of available settings (but actually this command is not available yet, so currently you can't change settings lmao)
